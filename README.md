Final Project - Slap or Else!

Changes from Game Proposal:
- Instead of providing a Start and Quit Button from the game, I have implemented a Game Timer and a Menu Button to go back to the Menu Scene.

Resources:
- https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TimeManager.html -> I used this to implement "Fixed Time Step" to help with my Card Dealing in FixedUpdate().
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.arraylist?view=net-5.0 -> I used this to help use ArrayList to store my cards in a deck and change my deck, as needed.
- https://gamedevbeginner.com/coroutines-in-unity-when-and-how-to-use-them/ -> I used this for some help on how to use Coroutines.
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html -> I used this to review on how to manage my scenes.
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.format?view=net-5.0 -> I used this to help format my Game Timer.
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.FloorToInt.html -> I used this to help me round out my Game Timer.

Build Instructions: The Game Build is in Build.zip. Please use to play the game. Note that I am on a Mac, and it may be best to run the game on a Mac.
